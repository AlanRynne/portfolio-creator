- title: Chebyshev Net Generation
  subtitle: Grasshopper component implemented in C#
  description: Chebyshev nets are a spetial kind of 3D grid composed only of segments of equal length. They are of special interest when designing elastically-bent gridshells, since the equal length property guarantees that the grid could be assembled 'flat' on-site, and later bent to it's final shape by either manual or mechanical means.
