- title: Geodesic Patterns for Freeform Architecture
  subtitle: Master Thesis - C# Implementation for Grasshopper
  description: "Implementation and analysis of different existing techniques to obtain cladding solutions using exclusively straight planks, either wood or metal, in order to weight their benefits and weaknesses from an architectural standpoint. The research was mainly centred on the generation of geodesic curves, more specifically straightest geodesics, which minimize distance between two points on curved surface. For cost and manufacturing reasons, geodesic planks are favorable for cladding solutions, as they can be manufactured and assembled using inexpensive construction techniques. We will also explain some basic structural analysis concepts to check the admissibility of the generated solutions."
