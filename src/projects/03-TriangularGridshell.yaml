  subtitle: Design & Construction of an actively-bent dome
  description: |
    The aim of this study is to design and build a 6 m diameter dome structure covered by a stretchable membrane; using the previously published work in Chebychev Net gridshells, the introduction of singularity points in the grid design, analyzing the behavior of the structure on different configurations and the relation between each ‘patch’ to each other.

    A special case exists when introducing a single valence 3 singularity on the center of a spherical dome: the bracing of each patch follows the same direction as the rods of its neighboring patches, leading to the assumption that structure and bracing could effectively be the same element. With this assumption, a number of new constructive problems arise when trying to erect the structure: Bracing joint should be left to slide freely in order to keep the structure flat during assembly, and would be fixed in place after the erection process.
