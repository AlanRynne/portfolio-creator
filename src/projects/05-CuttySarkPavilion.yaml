- title: Cutty Sark Pavillion
  subtitle: Building adaptation study
  description: |
    The purpose of this study was to analyze in depth an already existing building solution, in this case: The cutty sark pavilion.
    The building is an effimeral Lightweight structure that was designed for the purpose of the Cutty Sark boat refurbishment.
    The building solution is comprised of 3 kinds of elements, wood beams which are in pure compression, the membrane which is in pure tension, and the cast steel nodes which connect both elements together. 
    
    Once the key parts where identified, a parametric design was implemented using Rhino+GrasshopperÂ® in order to adapt the solution to a completely different shape: *A dupin cyclide*. You can find more info about this project on my website.
