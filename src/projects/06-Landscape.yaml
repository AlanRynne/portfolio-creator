    In this case, we looked into the problematic of buiilding uban rooftop gardens: How to relicate a given topography on a rooftop, without overloading the structure nor adding unwanted filtrations to the underlying building floors? we opted for a 'hollow box' solution, that would allow us to raise the initial slab level in order to optimize for weight.
    
    The height of this boxes was calculating taking into account the different vegetation that would exist in each area and their specific soil + watering needs in order guarantee their survival. Water drainage was also taken into account (Fig 6.3) when placing the different species.

    The result is an underlying topography between the desired one and the original slabs, creating more soil height around trees, while minimizing it on grass areas.
