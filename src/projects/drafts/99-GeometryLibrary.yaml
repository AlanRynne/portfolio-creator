- title: C# Architectural Geometry Library
  subtitle: Compatible with Grasshopper and Dynamo
  description: After finishing my Master's Degree, I started an Open Source project to bring together all the scripts I have been developing into a more accessible and easy to use library. Currently, it supports basic mesh operations based on the 'half-edge mesh' concept, geodesic paths on meshes by solving the 'initial value problem' and the generation of geodesic patterns for panelization with planks, and other utility algorithms like water-drainage on meshes, calculating level-sets, etc. This library is still a work in progress.
